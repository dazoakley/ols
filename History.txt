=== 0.3.3 2011-11-11

* Minor cache modification - hold the marshaled strings in ram rather than repeadedly
  read off disk.  This should ease pain when there are lots of concurrent requests to
  a slow file system.

=== 0.3.2 2011-11-09

* Bugfix - the term_name was getting lost off of the new nodes when we merged two graphs.
* Small feature enhancement - when printing the graph to stdout, add an option to print
  out the term_name too.

=== 0.3.1 2011-11-08

* Renamed the OLS::Term.detach_* methods to much more sensible names.

=== 0.3.0 2011-11-08

* Addition of new functions to deatch graphs from parents/children.
* Small code clean and refactor of utility functions.
* The OLS::Term.size method has been altered to return a count of unique nodes.

=== 0.2.1 2011-11-07

* Cache bugfix.  Removed the use of 'Dir.chdir' as it was firing warnings.

=== 0.2.0 2011-11-07

* Addition of a basic cache layer. Users can now cache regularly used ontologies on disk.

=== 0.1.0 2011-11-04

* Total rewrite (as a result please note API changes)...
  * Switch to using the OLS SOAP service instead of local MySQL instance.
  * Remove the use of RubyTree as ontologies are Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), not trees.

=== 0.0.1 2011-04-15

* Initial release:
  * Basic wrapper around OLS database.
  * Builds tree objects automagically.
  * User configurable connection details.
